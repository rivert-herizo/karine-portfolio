                    During a nighttime escapade, two students decide to squat in what appears to be an empty house. 
                    But their ordinary evening quickly takes a sinister turn when something catches their attention. 
                    Something they were never meant to see. Something that will mark the beginning of a strange and terrifying adventure that will change them forever.</p>
                <p class="box-text-content">
                    We’re all chasing something, aren’t we? Something we believe — or rather, hope — has the power to give us that ultimate thrill. Or simply the will to live.
                    It was a Tuesday night, just before midnight. Wrapped in a thick black hoodie, Kennedy crept out of her father’s office as quietly as possible after having unplugged the surveillance camera server. Every few steps, she froze, listening to make sure the snoring from her parents’ bedroom — just a few paces away — hadn’t stopped. On tiptoe, she headed for the kitchen, where her sneakers and her ever-faithful gray backpack were waiting for her on the tiled floor. She grabbed them and slowly opened the door that led outside. Once the opening was wide enough, she slipped out like a cat and closed it behind her, still in total silence.
                    As she bent down to put on her shoes, something cold and wet brushed against her leg, making her jump. She turned around to find a big dog staring at her. Paco, the German shepherd, wagged his tail excitedly at the sight of his mistress and started bouncing around, eager to play. Kennedy patted his head and planted a big kiss between his ears before heading toward the backyard of the vast property.
                    At the very back, behind a tangle of brambles, was an old wooden stile. She dragged it to the other side of the garden and propped it against the wall. After giving Paco — who hadn’t left her side since — a tap on the head, she climbed up. Once at the top, she lifted the ladder again, now placing it on the street side, and climbed down.
                    Once on the ground, she carefully hid the escape tool behind the bushes.
                    Suddenly, the yellow glow of a car’s headlights lit her up for a second before disappearing, plunging the driveway back into darkness.

                    The sky was darkening and drops of water began to fall slowly. Thunder could be heard approaching. 
                    Soon, the rain would pour over the empty field. 
                    Sure, the car wrecks scattered there made good shelters, but the problem was the parents. 
                    If they came home soaked, they’d be scolded. Yet none of the three children seemed willing to move. 
                    They were crouched on the ground behind a tireless grey Golf, staring at the corpse of a bird they had placed earlier on the other side of the old beater. 
                    It had been Zeke’s idea. Ever since a stray dog had settled on their playground—their precious little rusty field, far from the city and the parents—the animal had enjoyed terrorizing them. 
                    The mutt particularly had it in for Rico. For some unknown reason, it was always him the dog attacked. When he got bitten on the arm, Zeke, like a good older brother, decided it was enough. 
                    That very day, after bringing his younger brother back home, he ran out of the house and didn’t return until several hours later, holding a dead pigeon, which he presented to Rico and Hazel.
                    “Tomorrow, it’s that bastard I’m going to kill.”

                    What day was it again? She couldn’t remember. She only recalled being heartbroken. 
                    That and the heat. It was a very hot, very sunny day… Alone in the stable, with the sounds of the reception in the distance, she sat on a bale of hay, surrounded by the quiet presence of the horses.
                    She was sweating under her long black dress and that stupid mantilla. 
                    Loïc dissuaded her from wearing it, but she didn’t listen. She rarely listened to her brother. 
                    And she wanted to cover her face anyway. Mostly because she didn’t want to face the guests. Wearing a veil created the ideal distance between her and her surroundings. She was there, but not really. Besides, she didn’t want people to see her cry. Or worse, not cry. They might think of her as some heartless brat who couldn’t even shed a tear for her poor daddy. But there were so many people. How can one be openly vulnerable in front of so many people? No. There weren’t any tears that day. Even though she was missing her father desperately. After all, they were best friends, he was her daddy, she was his little princess.

                    1. EXT. ROAD - EARLY MORNING

                        Few minutes before sunrise. The colorful bus slaloms on the
                        road surrounded by green nature. Calm and peaceful.

                    2. INT./EXT. BUS - CONTINUOUS

                        Inside the bus, people are squeezed to each other, struggling
                        to find a position to sleep in. OCÉANE (24) is in the back.
                        She is awake, her eyes are tired. She is pressed between the
                        window and some OLD LADY who fell asleep on her shoulder. She
                        holds her back pack tightly on her legs.

                        The old lady snores a little. Océane sighs and looks outside.
                        The sun rises slowly. The landscape is beautiful but she is
                        sad.

                    3. EXT. BUS STATION - LATER

                        Océane sits on the bench with her backpack and luggage. She
                        looks around, clearly lost.
                        The previous passengers are picked up by their relatives,
                        including the old lady who fell asleep on her shoulder
                        earlier.

                        After a few times, she is left alone in the parking lot. She
                        finally stands up and walks to a cab.

                    4. INT./EXT. CAB - DAY

                        The cab goes through the town, its streets, a school, a
                        supermarket, a park. There are only a few people outside.
                        Océane looks around with an empty expression.
                        Soon, the cab leaves the town to take a road leading to the
                        countryside.

                    5. EXT. ROAD - DAY
                        The cab leaves her at the edges of a dirt road adjoining the
                        main road. She takes a look around before following the dirt
                        road.

                    1. EXT. MARKAT - MORNING
                    The people of Markat are setting up the market. The streets are crowded. Carts, oxen, stalls, merchants carrying their goods, stirring up dust into the air.
                    Men are setting up their stalls in the village square.
                    Women come out of their homes with baskets under their arms.
                    Children play tag in the streets and bump into a LITTLE BOY, who falls, along with his toys: a wooden snake and a small human figurine. The boy, about 8 years old, grimaces and gets up. He brushes off his clothes. He picks up his toys.
                    He keeps playing with them, making the snake and the figure fight.

                    LITTLE BOY
                    (playing with the figure)
                    Take that, you monster! I'm the strongest! Pow! Pow!
                    The human defeats the snake, which falls to the ground.
                    LITTLE BOY
                    Yeah!!!
                    The boy jumps around. He smiles and prepares to pick up the snake.
                    The snake on the ground trembles — the earth itself is shaking.
                    The boy watches, one eyebrow raised, surprised. A sudden breeze blows from behind, rustling his clothes and hair. Without picking up his toy, he turns around.
                    He sees houses and, in the distance, the great dark forest.
                    He squints.
                    Far off, the treetops are shaking violently, as if someone is shoving the trees aside to make their way through. It looks like it’s coming straight toward the village — fast.
                    The boy drops the human figure. The figurine is caught by the wind. It lands under a cart and gets crushed.
                    We see the crushed figurine in the foreground, and the boy, from behind, staring at the forest.
                    The thing is getting closer.
